<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
Consumers often have the problem of receiving discount offers for things they do not really need. Moreover, retailers also have problems when it comes to targeting the right customers for their discounts.
Card-linked offers (CLO) is a Online-to-Offline (O2O) system, meaning the online marketing leads to an offline (physical) experience, helping mitigate the problems for both entities. Firstly by getting consumers behavior data (with their consent), analysing it, enabling the retailers to make specific marketing campaigns. Secondly by having personalized offers to each consumer, applying the discounts automatically on each purchase just by using the credit or debit card, discarding the need for coupons, promo codes or membership cards.
This way consumers avoid offers for merchants they do not really need, leaving only offers to what they are looking for and turns digital banking into a marketing channel for retailers, benefiting both parts.
Pacaward is a CLO Android application that integrates Fidel API (Application Programming Interface) and Fidel SDK (Software Development Kit). Using Fidel tools is a great benefit to this project since they already passed difficult barriers caused by the need of accessing customer payment data, consequently there is no need to deal with sensitive data. 
CLO is a booming market as a result of the shift to cashless (growth of 20% per year), thus there are many apps related to this, the most relevant being:
<ul>
	<li>Acorns¹ (https://www.acorns.com/) - in every purchase with a liked-card, rounds up to next dollar, giving the user a choice to save or invest their change.</li>
	<li>Dosh² (https://www.dosh.cash/) - partner of more than 1000 stores and restaurants, has a referral system where users can earn money when a friend links a card.</li> 
	<li>Drop³ (https://www.earnwithdrop.com/) - works with points instead of direct cashback.</li>
</ul>
Although there are many CLO applications like the ones presented before, all applications differ in their partners, meaning there will be distinct retailers, therefore different offers. Apps also differ in the way they offer their discounts, some work with direct cashback, others use a points system forcing the users to spend it on other offers.
